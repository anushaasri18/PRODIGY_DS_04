Data Preparation: We extracted the text of tweets from the dataset and performed sentiment analysis to assign sentiment scores to each tweet. These scores indicate the positivity or negativity of the tweets.

Sentiment Analysis: Using the sentimentr package, we calculated sentiment scores, which are numeric values representing the sentiment polarity of each tweet. Positive scores indicate positive sentiment, negative scores indicate negative sentiment, and scores close to zero indicate neutral sentiment.

Summary Statistics: We grouped the tweets by their sentiment scores and counted the occurrences of each score. This step helps us understand the overall distribution of sentiment in the dataset.

Visualization: We created a histogram to visualize the distribution of sentiment scores. The histogram provides a visual summary of how sentiment scores are distributed across the dataset.

Interpreting the Results
From the summary statistics and histogram, we can draw several conclusions:

Distribution Shape: The shape of the histogram tells us whether the sentiment scores are normally distributed, skewed, or have any outliers. For example, if most tweets have a sentiment score close to zero, it suggests that the tweets are generally neutral.
Central Tendency: By looking at the peak of the histogram, we can determine the most common sentiment score in the dataset. If the peak is on the positive side, it indicates that most tweets are positive.
Variability: The spread of the histogram shows the variability in sentiment scores. A wide spread indicates a diverse range of sentiments, while a narrow spread suggests that most tweets have similar sentiment scores.
This analysis provides a high-level overview of the sentiment in the Twitter dataset.
